## IMPASTO

This is the official repository of **IMPASTO**, a protection technology developed and researched by **NAVER WEBTOON AI** to prevent mimicry by personalized diffusion models.
<!-- The name IMPASTO is inspired by the impasto painting technique, where thick, textured brushstrokes create a sense of depth, symbolizing its approach of inserting additional signals into content to prevent unauthorized model training and replication. -->
